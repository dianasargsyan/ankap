# Number-Plate-Recognition-in-Armenia

This capstone project presents an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system designed to detect and 
recognize Armenian license plates. The system employs an object detection algorithm to detect license plates, 
applies skew and rotation adjustment to correct the orientation, and uses optical character recognition to recognize 
the characters on the plate. The project achieves a high accuracy rate of 90% on plate detection and 95% on 
character recognition on a manually collected dataset consisting of high-quality photos and videos. Overall, 
this project presents a promising solution for ANPR systems.

The full reproducible code is available in the Detection&Recognition.py file

The following link provides the dataset of images and their respective label .txt files which have the bounding box coordinates of 
the license plates. The folder also includes all images used in the research paper, the weight .pt file of the object detection training,
and other materials which may be helpful to implementing a similar system.
